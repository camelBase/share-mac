PPhys2D - A physic library for Processing
http://pphys2d.jmcouillard.com/
(June 2th 2009 build).


Informations
----------------------------------------------------------

PPhys2D is a Processing library that consist in a powerful physic system
combined with efficient drawing functions. It allows visual artist and game
programmers to include physic effects to their work. Its simplified usage and
and drawing fonctionnalities will helps you to start using it quickly, and
EASILY.

PPhys2D is and adaptation of an existing library named Phys2D hosted by Coke and
Code. All the physic engine and mathematical operations where taken from that
Java library and are not from my own. Phys2D is essentially a port and rework of
the GDC 2006 presentation from Erin Catto plus some extensions. More information
about this library here. The original source remains: Erin Catto (Copyright
2006).

Installation notes
----------------------------------------------------------

1. You need to download (http://pphys2d.jmcouillard.com/) the library and
extract it the Processing libraries folder (the "pphys2d" folder needs to
be inside your "libraries" folder).

2.Create a new skecth and import PPhys2D library. You can do that using Skecth -
Import Library - pphys2d.

3. You will need to setup a PPWorld object in the setup() section of your sketch.
You should take a look at related exemples for more information.

4. You will need to call world.draw(this) in the draw() section of your sketch.
You should take a look at related exemples for more information.
